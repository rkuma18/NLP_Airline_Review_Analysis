# Airline Review Analysis

Hi there! Welcome to my project analyzing airline reviews. I scraped over 1000 reviews from a website and did some natural language processing on the text to uncover insights. 

## About the Project 

I was tasked with digging into customer feedback data to surface key themes and sentiments about a major airline. This involved:

- Using Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape review text from a website 
- Cleaning and preprocessing the text data - removing stopwords, punctuation etc.
- Doing sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, negative or neutral
- Applying topic modeling with LDA to identify common topics and themes
- Generating wordclouds and charts to visualize the data
- Summarizing findings in a presentation

## Key Insights

After crunching through the data, here are some of the top things I found:

- Reviews were ~60% positive and 35% negative - more good than bad feedback!
- The most common topics were flight experience, food quality, and customer service
- Positive reviews highlighted comfort, entertainment, and friendly staff
- Negative reviews complained about discomfort, delays, and poor food

## Running the Analysis

If you want to play with the data and code yourself, check out the Jupyter notebook included. It has the web scraping and NLP steps I followed. Feel free to tweak and build on it!

The main libraries used include Numpy, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Matplotlib and scikit-learn. There are ample comments to help explain each part.

## Next Steps

This was a neat project to get hands-on with text mining. Next I could look at expanding the dataset with more airlines, doing deeper linguistic analysis, and building a classification model. Let me know if you have any other fun ideas for improving or extending the analysis!
